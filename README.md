A smartphone app to sign and verify digital signatures embedded in QR codes developed as part of my bachelor thesis.

This app is based on Android - hence implemented in Java - and uses the required basic functionalities for encoding/decoding barcodes from the ZXing library (https://github.com/zxing/zxing) and the java.security.* package for signing/verifying data.
